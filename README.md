Instructions:

Task 1: Given the planets.csv file - 1. Draw a bar chart showing the density of the planets. 2. Draw a pie chart showing the percentage of planets with negative rotation values vs positive rotation values. 3. Draw a (multiple) line chart with x-axis as planets and y-axis as the gravity. 4. Plot a chart of your choice using any data given in the data file.

Task 2: Given the 5000_points.txt file with each line contains a point's x-coordinate and y-coodinate respectively; you may scale the coordinates properly if needed. 1. Draw a scatter graph to show all points. 2. Draw a scatter graph that shows points in even position (assume starting from index 0, i.e. P0, P2, ...) with red color and points in odd position (i.e. P1, P3, ...) with green color. 3. Draw a bar comparing the number of points in these three groups (x < y, x==y, and x > y where x and y are coordinates of a point) 4. Plot a chart of your choice using the data given in the data file.
